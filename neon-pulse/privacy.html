                        Data Collection and Usage Your privacy is our priority. Neon Pulse is designed as an
                        offline-first gaming experience, and we do not knowingly collect, store, transmit, or share any
                        personally identifiable information (PII) from our users. All game-related data, such as your
                        high scores, game progress, and settings preferences (sound and haptics), is stored locally on
                        your device's internal storage. This data remains entirely under your control and is never sent
                        to external servers. We do not require you to create an account or log in to play, ensuring your
                        gaming habits and identity remain private and accessible only to you on your specific device.

                        distributed through the Google Play Store, which may collect standard usage data and crash
                        reports as governed by Google's own privacy policies to help us improve app stability. We
                        request minimal permissions, specifically to access your device's vibration hardware for haptic
                        feedback and audio output for sound effects, which are used solely to enhance gameplay
                        immersion. We take reasonable measures to protect the limited local data we store, but please be
                        aware that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. By using Neon Pulse, you consent to
                        this policy. If you have questions, please contact the developer.
